Cowboy dreams, Texas size
Old Men telling bitter lies
Drawing new lines in the sand
Bringing out the heavy hand

Like the Hebrew women stoned
supposed cruel wrath atoned
Driving out the cursed other
In the name of God the father

Kick the humbled from the joint
the cruelty is just the point
take your synod and your guns
And run
